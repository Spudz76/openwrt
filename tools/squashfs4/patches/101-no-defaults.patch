Subject: tools/squashfs4: adjust for squashfs option updates

enable all compressors, set `COMP_DEFAULT` to zstd, configuration can
easily override the default where zstd is not preferable

add PREFIX support to upstream Makefile via patch

define `Host/Uninstall` Makefile target, use default build args rather
than overriding `Host/Compile` and `Host/Install` targets
